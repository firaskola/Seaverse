                  SEAVERSE was founded in 2024 by Shreesha H Acharya, an entrepreneur with a deep passion for the ocean and a mind wired for innovation. What started as a dream to merge marine science with advanced technology has evolved into one of the most ambitious marine research & technology ventures of our time.

                <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
                  With a clear mission to harness the power of the ocean through sustainability, biotechnology, and robotics, SEAVERSE has become a pioneering force in the marine economy. From AI-powered underwater bots to nutraceutical algae breakthroughs, every project we build is rooted in scientific precision, environmental responsibility, and a bold drive to reimagine the relationship between humanity and the ocean.
